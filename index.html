                    <p class="description">Bangladesh's first communication satellite, Bangabandhu-1, was launched in May 2018, enhancing the nation's telecommunications and broadcasting capabilities. In September 2023, Bangladesh signed a Letter of Intent with Airbus Defence and Space SAS to develop the Bangabandhu-2 Earth Observation Satellite System, aiming to bolster the country's space technology and data collection capabilities.However, the Bangabandhu-1 satellite has become a significant financial burden, incurring an annual loss of approximately 66 crore taka, raising concerns about its economic viability.Additionally, Bangladesh has opened its satellite internet licenses to foreign firms, aiming to enhance connectivity and competition in the telecommunications sector.
